Multiplayer tic-tac-toe on a 25*25 board with 4 pieces instead of just 2 and everyone plays at the same time. Chaos? Yes.

## Notes
This project started as a simple test of Svelte, but I kept adding new things to it and it grew this. I have however loved working with Svelte and I'll definitely create new projects with it in the future. I can confidently say that Svelte is now my favourite framework.  

## Ideas for the future
* Add mobile support
* Optimize performance
* Make it at least a bit hack-proof
